Okay, let's proceed with Step 7: Hook Backend to Frontend.

I'll update the React code in the no_dues_react_frontend_mui immersive. The main changes will involve:

Setting up Axios: Uncommenting and configuring the apiClient.
Replacing Mock API Calls: Updating LoginPage, RegisterPage, StudentDashboard, StaffDashboard, and AdminDashboard to use apiClient for actual backend communication.
Handling Responses: Processing data, errors, and loading states from API calls.
Navigation: Using useNavigate for routing after actions.
Improving UI: Using MUI Dialog for the staff action modal and Select for role selection in registration.
This will make the frontend interact with the backend APIs we've built.

I've updated the no_dues_react_frontend_mui immersive with the following key changes for Step 7:

Axios (apiClient):
The apiClient is now fully configured at the top of the file.
The baseURL will use process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL (defaulting to http://localhost:5000/api). You'll need to create a .env file in your React project's root with this variable set to your backend's address.
The request interceptor correctly retrieves the token from localStorage (within the noDuesUser object) and adds it to the Authorization header.
AuthContext:
The login function now expects userData directly from the backend, which should include both the token and the user object ({id, name, email, role, department?}). This entire object is stored in localStorage and set as the user state.
A loading state is used in AuthProvider to prevent rendering children until the initial auth check (from localStorage) is complete. This loading state is also consumed by ProtectedRoute.
ProtectedRoute:
Now uses the loading state from AuthContext to show a CircularProgress while the initial authentication status is being determined, preventing premature redirects.
LoginPage:
handleLogin now makes an asynchronous call to /api/auth/login using apiClient.
On successful login, it calls auth.login() with the response data and navigates the user to their respective dashboard using useNavigate().
Includes an effect to redirect already logged-in users away from the login page.
RegisterPage:
handleRegister calls /api/auth/register.
Includes a FormControl with Select and MenuItem from MUI for role selection (Student/Staff). Admin registration is typically handled differently.
For staff registration, it attempts to fetch existing departments to populate a Select dropdown. If fetching fails or isn't desired, it falls back to a TextField for departmentName. The backend expects departmentName for staff registration.
On success, it shows a message and redirects to the login page.
StudentDashboard:
fetchMyRequests calls GET /api/requests/my.
createNewRequest calls POST /api/requests and then refreshes the list.
downloadPdf constructs the full URL to GET /api/requests/:id/pdf and uses window.open() to trigger the download.
StaffDashboard:
fetchPendingRequests calls GET /api/requests.
handleActionSubmit (for the modal) calls PUT /api/requests/:id/action.
The modal for approving/rejecting requests is now implemented using MUI's Dialog, DialogTitle, DialogContent, DialogContentText, and DialogActions for a better user experience.
AdminDashboard:
fetchDepartments calls GET /api/departments.
fetchAllRequests calls GET /api/requests/all.
handleAddDepartment calls POST /api/departments.
Admin can also view PDF for approved requests.
Error Handling & Loading: Basic try...catch blocks are used for API calls, setting error messages in state, and displaying them with MUI Alert. CircularProgress is used for loading states.
Navigation: useNavigate hook from react-router-dom is imported and used for programmatic navigation.
Layout: The main Layout component now has a Box wrapper with minHeight: '100vh' and flexDirection: 'column' to ensure the footer sticks to the bottom, even on pages with little content. The main content area uses flexGrow: 1.
Dependencies: Added axios to the list of required npm packages.
To run this updated frontend:

Make sure you have axios installed: npm install axios.
Create a .env file in the root of your no-dues-frontend project (e.g., no-dues-frontend/.env) and add your backend API URL: REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api (Adjust the port if your backend runs on a different one).
Ensure your backend server (Node.js/Express) is running.
Start your React development server: npm start.
You should now be able to register users, log in, and perform the core actions for each role, with data being fetched from and sent to your backend.

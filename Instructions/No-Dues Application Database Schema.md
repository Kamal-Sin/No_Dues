No-Dues Application: Database Schema (MongoDB/Mongoose)This document outlines the database schema for the No-Dues Form application. We'll use Mongoose to define these schemas for our MongoDB database.1. User SchemaThis schema will store information about all users of the application, including students, department staff, and administrators.// models/User.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const userSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    trim: true,
    lowercase: true,
    // Basic email validation
    match: [/.+\@.+\..+/, 'Please fill a valid email address'],
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    // Password will be hashed, so no need for minLength here directly,
    // but validation should be handled before hashing.
  },
  role: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    enum: ['student', 'staff', 'admin'], // Predefined roles
  },
  // Department will be relevant for 'staff' role
  department: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Department', // Reference to the Department collection
    // Not required for students or admin, can be null
    // Or, make it conditionally required based on role in application logic
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
  updatedAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});

// Middleware to update `updatedAt` field before saving
userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  this.updatedAt = Date.now();
  next();
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
Fields Explained:name: Full name of the user.email: Unique email address, used for login.password: Hashed password for security.role: Defines the user's access level and capabilities within the system.student: Can request no-dues forms and view their status.staff: Can approve/reject requests for their assigned department.admin: Can manage departments, users (potentially), and view all requests.department: (For staff role) A reference to the Department collection, indicating which department the staff member belongs to. This is crucial for routing no-dues requests to the correct approvers.createdAt, updatedAt: Timestamps for record creation and last update.2. Department SchemaThis schema will store information about the various departments within the university that need to provide clearance.// models/Department.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const departmentSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true, // Department names should be unique
    trim: true,
  },
  // Optional: To track who created the department, useful for admin logs
  createdBy: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User', // Reference to the User who is an admin
    required: true,
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
  updatedAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});

// Middleware to update `updatedAt` field before saving
departmentSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  this.updatedAt = Date.now();
  next();
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Department', departmentSchema);
Fields Explained:name: The name of the department (e.g., "Library", "Hostel", "Accounts", "Sports").createdBy: A reference to the admin user who added this department.createdAt, updatedAt: Timestamps.3. NoDuesRequest SchemaThis is the core schema that tracks the no-dues request initiated by a student and the approval process by various departments.// models/NoDuesRequest.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const approvalSchema = new Schema({
  department: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Department',
    required: true,
  },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['pending', 'approved', 'rejected'],
    default: 'pending',
    required: true,
  },
  comment: {
    type: String,
    trim: true,
    default: '',
  },
  approvedBy: { // Staff member who approved/rejected
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
  },
  timestamp: { // When the approval/rejection was made
    type: Date,
  },
}, {_id: false}); // _id is not needed for subdocuments here if not queried directly

const noDuesRequestSchema = new Schema({
  student: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User', // Reference to the student User
    required: true,
  },
  departmentsStatus: [approvalSchema], // Array of approval statuses from each department
  overallStatus: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['pending', 'in-progress', 'approved', 'rejected'],
    default: 'pending', // Overall status of the no-dues request
    required: true,
  },
  // To be filled when all departments have approved
  finalApprovalDate: {
    type: Date,
  },
  // Potentially store a reference to the generated PDF, e.g., its path or ID
  pdfReference: {
    type: String,
    trim: true,
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
  updatedAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});

// Middleware to update `updatedAt` field before saving
noDuesRequestSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  this.updatedAt = Date.now();
  // Logic to update overallStatus based on departmentsStatus can be added here
  // or in the application layer before saving.
  // For example:
  const allApproved = this.departmentsStatus.every(dept => dept.status === 'approved');
  const anyRejected = this.departmentsStatus.some(dept => dept.status === 'rejected');

  if (anyRejected) {
    this.overallStatus = 'rejected';
  } else if (allApproved && this.departmentsStatus.length > 0) { // Ensure departmentsStatus is populated
    this.overallStatus = 'approved';
    if (!this.finalApprovalDate) { // Set final approval date only once
        this.finalApprovalDate = Date.now();
    }
  } else if (this.departmentsStatus.some(dept => dept.status === 'approved' || dept.status === 'rejected')) {
    this.overallStatus = 'in-progress';
  } else {
    this.overallStatus = 'pending';
  }

  next();
});

// When a new NoDuesRequest is created, it should automatically populate
// `departmentsStatus` with all existing departments, each with a 'pending' status.
// This can be handled in the controller logic when creating a request.

module.exports = mongoose.model('NoDuesRequest', noDuesRequestSchema);
Fields Explained:student: A reference to the student user who initiated the request.departmentsStatus: An array of objects, where each object represents the status of approval from a specific department.department: Reference to the Department.status: Current status (pending, approved, rejected).comment: Optional comments from the department staff.approvedBy: Reference to the staff user who took action.timestamp: When the action was taken.overallStatus: The overall status of the no-dues request. This can be derived from the departmentsStatus array.pending: Request submitted, no department has acted yet.in-progress: Some departments have acted, but not all.approved: All departments have approved.rejected: At least one department has rejected the request.finalApprovalDate: Timestamp for when the request received all approvals.pdfReference: (Optional) A string to store a reference to the generated PDF, like a file path or an ID if stored in a separate service.createdAt, updatedAt: Timestamps.Modularity and Scalability Considerations:Clear Separation: Each entity (User, Department, NoDuesRequest) has its own model, promoting modularity.Referencing: Using ObjectId references (ref) allows for relational data linking without embedding large documents, which is good for scalability and data integrity (e.g., if a department name changes, it only changes in one place).Indexes: For performance, especially on fields used in queries (e.g., email in User, name in Department, student and departmentsStatus.department in NoDuesRequest), indexes should be defined in MongoDB. Mongoose can define these at the schema level or they can be created directly in the database.userSchema.index({ email: 1 });departmentSchema.index({ name: 1 });noDuesRequestSchema.index({ student: 1 });noDuesRequestSchema.index({ "departmentsStatus.department": 1 });noDuesRequestSchema.index({ overallStatus: 1 });Subdocuments vs. Collections: The approvalSchema is used as a subdocument array within NoDuesRequest. This is suitable because the lifecycle of an approval is tightly coupled with the no-dues request itself. If approvals needed to be queried independently or had more complex logic, they could be moved to a separate collection.Scalability of departmentsStatus: If the number of departments becomes extremely large (e.g., hundreds), querying and updating the departmentsStatus array might become less efficient. However, for a typical university setup, this approach should be fine. For massive scale, one might consider a separate Approval collection linking NoDuesRequest and Department. For this project's scope, the current design is appropriate.Dynamic Department Addition: When a new NoDuesRequest is created, the application logic will need to fetch all current Department documents and populate the departmentsStatus array with entries for each, initially marked as 'pending'. This ensures that new departments are automatically included in new requests.This schema design provides a structured way to store and manage the data for your no-dues application.
